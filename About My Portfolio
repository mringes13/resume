To whom it may concern,

My independent portfolio and collection of projects are just beginning! I am currently a web development intern at Colony Brands and have coded many 
pages for them, as seen in the pdf also contained in this folder. Due to such projects accessing images/links located in a larger database, the code I
have written for them will not display appropriately to outside personel.

If you are interested in looking at codes I have completed, please email me at m.ringes@me.com to discuss how this could be achieved. 

Thank you for your interest!
Maria Ringes
